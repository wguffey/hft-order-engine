CF --> OBE : Better cache usage

LF --> OBE : No contention
TP --> MDF : Parallel processing
WS --> AE : Load balancing
NUMA --> OM : Memory locality

SIMD --> MDF : Faster parsing
BP --> OM : Faster matching
RT --> OBE : O(log n) lookups
HL --> OBE : O(1) lookups

AIO --> MDF : Non-blocking I/O
BATCH --> AE : Amortized cost
ZCNET --> MDF : Reduced copying
DMA --> MDF : Hardware acceleration

LH --> OBE : Measure performance

MEM --> OBE : Track allocations
CACHE --> OBE : Optimize data layout

note bottom of MP
  Memory pools pre-allocate objects to avoid
  dynamic allocations during critical paths
end note

note bottom of LF
  Lock-free structures eliminate mutex
  contention in high-throughput scenarios
end note

note bottom of SIMD
  SIMD instructions process multiple
  data elements in a single operation
end note

note bottom of AIO
  Asynchronous I/O prevents blocking
  on network or disk operations
end note
